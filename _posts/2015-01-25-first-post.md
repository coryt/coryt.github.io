###I've finally decided to start a blog! 
*Yes I know*, everyone has a blog and it's really nothing special, but I'm hoping it will be a new creative outlet for me to express some thoughts and explore the topics I don't get the opportunity to use on a daily basis, maybe something I've read recently or maybe I *will* showcase some of the things I'm working on. 

I don't really know where this will end up, so let's just begin and see what happens.
